# Privacy & Safety

This tool is built with privacy as a core design goal.

- **No passwords are sent to any server.** The site runs fully client-side (in your browser).
- **Do not paste real production passwords.** The UI is intentionally focused on generated examples and hypothetical inputs.
- **Offline mode:** you can install the PWA or download the single-file snapshot to run entirely offline.
- **Third-party libraries:** strength estimation uses zxcvbn from a CDN. If you prefer full offline usage, download the page snapshot (Download ZIP) and use it locally.
- **No telemetry by default.** The site contains no analytics. If you add analytics, exclude any data that could reveal passwords or hashes.

If you plan to publish this widely, add a prominent warning on the landing page: _“Do not paste real passwords — use generated examples or run this page offline.”_
